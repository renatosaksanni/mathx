## Introduction

This repository serves as a hub for mathematical experimentations and performance optimizations in Golang. Whether you're working on numerical methods, linear algebra, or statistical analysis, our goal is to explore and implement the best practices and techniques to make these computations faster and more memory-efficient.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.18 or higher.
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renatosaksanni/mathx.git
cd mathx
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Projects

### Current Projects

1. **Cryptography/ECC**: ECC is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. It provides the same level of security as other cryptographic methods with smaller key sizes, making it more efficient.

   
2. **Cryptography/ECDH**: key exchange protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. This shared secret can then be used to derive encryption keys for secure communication. ECDH is a variant of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, which uses the properties of elliptic curves to achieve its cryptographic strength.


## Optimization Techniques

### Memory Management

- **Preallocation**: Preallocate slices and arrays to avoid dynamic memory allocations during computations.
- **Pooling**: Use `sync.Pool` for managing temporary objects and reducing garbage collection overhead.

### Parallel Processing

- **Goroutines**: Leverage Golang’s concurrency model using goroutines and channels for parallel computations.
- **Worker Pools**: Implement worker pools to manage and distribute computational tasks efficiently.

### Profiling and Benchmarking

- **pprof**: Use the `pprof` tool to profile CPU and memory usage, identifying bottlenecks and optimizing performance.
- **Benchmarking**: Implement benchmarks using the `testing` package to measure and compare the performance of different algorithms.

### Real-World Examples

We include real-world examples and case studies demonstrating how these techniques have been applied to achieve significant performance improvements.
